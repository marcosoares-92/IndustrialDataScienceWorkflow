        # regex basic theory and most common metacharacters
        self.help_text_1 = """
        REGular EXpression or regex:
        String containing a combination of normal characters and special metacharacters that
        describes patterns to find text or positions within a text.

        Example:

        r'st\d\s\w{3,10}'
        - In Python, the r at the beginning indicates a raw string. It is always advisable to use it.
        - We said that a regex contains normal characters, or literal characters we already know. 
            - The normal characters match themselves. 
            - In the case shown above, 'st' exactly matches an 's' followed by a 't'.

        - Most important metacharacters:
            - \d: digit (number);
            - \D: non-digit;
            - \s: whitespace;
            - \s+: one or more consecutive whitespaces.
            - \S: non-whitespace;
            - \w: (word) character;
            - \W: non-word character.
            - {N, M}: indicates that the character on the left appears from N to M consecutive times.
                - \w{3,10}: a word character that appears 3, 4, 5,..., or 10 consecutive times.
            - {N}: indicates that the character on the left appears exactly N consecutive times.
                - \d{4}: a digit appears 4 consecutive times.
            - {N,}: indicates that the character appears at least N times.
                - \d{4,}: a digit appears 4 or more times.
                - phone_number = "John: 1-966-847-3131 Michelle: 54-908-42-42424"
                - re.findall(r"\d{1,2}-\d{3}-\d{2,3}-\d{4,}", phone_number) - returns: ['1-966-847-3131', '54-908-42-42424']

        ATTENTION: Using metacharacters in regular expressions will allow you to match types of characters such as digits. 
        - You can encounter many forms of whitespace such as tabs, space or new line. 
        - To make sure you match all of them always specify whitespaces as \s.

        re module: Python standard library module to search regex within individual strings.

        - .findall method: search all occurrences of the regex within the string, returning a list of strings.
        - Syntax: re.findall(r"regex", string)
            - Example: re.findall(r"#movies", "Love #movies! I had fun yesterday going to the #movies")
                - Returns: ['#movies', '#movies']

        - .split method: splits the string at each occurrence of the regex, returning a list of strings.
        - Syntax: re.split(r"regex", string)
            - Example: re.split(r"!", "Nice Place to eat! I'll come back! Excellent meat!")
                - Returns: ['Nice Place to eat', " I'll come back", ' Excellent meat', '']

        - .sub method: replace one or many matches of the regex with a given string (returns a replaced string).
        - Syntax: re.sub((r"regex", new_substring, original_string))
            - Example: re.sub(r"yellow", "nice", "I have a yellow car and a yellow house in a yellow neighborhood")
            - Returns: 'I have a nice car and a nice house in a nice neighborhood'

        - .search and .match methods: they have the same syntax and are used to find a match. 
            - Both methods return an object with the match found. 
            - The difference is that .match is anchored at the beginning of the string.
        - Syntax: re.search(r"regex", string) and re.match(r"regex", string)
            - Example 1: re.search(r"\d{4}", "4506 people attend the show")
            - Returns: <_sre.SRE_Match object; span=(0, 4), match='4506'>
            - re.match(r"\d{4}", "4506 people attend the show")
            - Returns: <_sre.SRE_Match object; span=(0, 4), match='4506'>
                - In this example, we use both methods to find a digit appearing four times. 
                - Both methods return an object with the match found.
            
            - Example 2: re.search(r"\d+", "Yesterday, I saw 3 shows")
            - Returns: <_sre.SRE_Match object; span=(17, 18), match='3'>
            - re.match(r"\d+","Yesterday, I saw 3 shows")
            - Returns: None
                - In this example,, we used them to find a match for a digit. 
                - In this case, .search finds a match, but .match does not. 
                - This is because the first characters do not match the regex.

        - .group method: detailed in Section 7 (Backreferences).
            - Retrieves the groups captured.
        - Syntax: searched_string = re.search(r"regex", string)
            re.group(N) - returns N-th group captured (group 0 is the regex itself).
            
            Example: text = "Python 3.0 was released on 12-03-2008."
            information = re.search('(\d{1,2})-(\d{2})-(\d{4})', text)
            information.group(3) - returns: '2008'
        - .group can only be used with .search and .match methods.

        Examples of regex:

        1. re.findall(r"User\d", "The winners are: User9, UserN, User8")
            ['User9', 'User8']
        2. re.findall(r"User\D", "The winners are: User9, UserN, User8")
            ['UserN']
        3. re.findall(r"User\w", "The winners are: User9, UserN, User8")
            ['User9', 'UserN', 'User8']
        4. re.findall(r"\W\d", "This skirt is on sale, only $5 today!")
            ['$5']
        5. re.findall(r"Data\sScience", "I enjoy learning Data Science")
            ['Data Science']
        6. re.sub(r"ice\Scream", "ice cream", "I really like ice-cream")
            'I really like ice cream'

        7. regex that matches the user mentions that starts with @ and follows the pattern @robot3!.

        regex = r"@robot\d\W"

        8. regex that matches the number of user mentions given as, for example: User_mentions:9.

        regex = r"User_mentions:\d"

        9. regex that matches the number of likes given as, for example, likes: 5.

        regex = r"likes:\s\d"

        10. regex that matches the number of retweets given as, for example, number of retweets: 4.

        regex = r"number\sof\sretweets:\s\d"

        11. regex that matches the user mentions that starts with @ and follows the pattern @robot3!.

        regex_sentence = r"\W\dbreak\W"

        12. regex that matches the pattern #newH

        regex_words = r"\Wnew\w"

        """

        # regex quantifiers
        self.help_text_2 = """
        Quantifiers: 
        A metacharacter that tells the regex engine how many times to match a character immediately to its left.

            1. +: Once or more times.
                - text = "Date of start: 4-3. Date of registration: 10-04."
                - re.findall(r"\d+-\d+", text) - returns: ['4-3', '10-04']
                - Again, \s+ represents one or more consecutive whitespaces.
            2. *: Zero times or more.
                - my_string = "The concert was amazing! @ameli!a @joh&&n @mary90"
                - re.findall(r"@\w+\W*\w+", my_string) - returns: ['@ameli!a', '@joh&&n', '@mary90']
            3. ?: Zero times or once: ?
                - text = "The color of this image is amazing. However, the colour blue could be brighter."
                - re.findall(r"colou?r", text) - returns: ['color', 'colour']
            
        The quantifier refers to the character immediately on the left:
        - r"apple+" : + applies to 'e' and not to 'apple'.

        Examples of regex:

        1. Most of the times, links start with 'http' and do not contain any whitespace, e.g. https://www.datacamp.com. 
        - regex to find all the matches of http links appearing:
            - regex = r"http\S+"
            - \S is very useful to use when you know a pattern does not contain spaces and you have reached the end when you do find one.

        2. User mentions in Twitter start with @ and can have letters and numbers only, e.g. @johnsmith3.
        - regex to find all the matches of user mentions appearing:
            - regex = r"@\w*\d*"

        3. regex that finds all dates in a format similar to 27 minutes ago or 4 hours ago.
        - regex = r"\d{1,2}\s\w+\sago"

        4. regex that finds all dates in a format similar to 23rd june 2018.
        - regex = r"\d{1,2}\w{2}\s\w+\s\d{4}"

        5. regex that finds all dates in a format similar to 1st september 2019 17:25.
        - regex = r"\d{1,2}\w{2}\s\w+\s\d{4}\s\d{1,2}:\d{2}"

        6. Hashtags start with a # symbol and contain letters and numbers but never whitespace.
        - regex that matches the described hashtag pattern.
            - regex = r"#\w+"

        self.help_text_3 = """
        - Anchoring and Finding Metacharacters

            1. . (dot): Match any character (except newline).
                - my_links = "Just check out this link: www.amazingpics.com. It has amazing photos!"
                - re.findall(r"www.+com", my_links) - returns: ['www.amazingpics.com']
                    - The dot . metacharacter is very useful when we want to match all repetitions of any character. 
                    - However, we need to be very careful how we use it.
            2. ^: Anchoring on start of the string.
                - my_string = "the 80s music was much better that the 90s"
                - If we do re.findall(r"the\s\d+s", my_string) - returns: ['the 80s', 'the 90s']
                - Using ^: re.findall(r"^the\s\d+s", my_string) - returns: ['the 80s']
            3. $: Anchoring at the end of the string.
                - my_string = "the 80s music hits were much better that the 90s"
                - re.findall(r"the\s\d+s$", my_string) - returns: ['the 90s']
            4. \: Escape special characters.
                - my_string = "I love the music of Mr.Go. However, the sound was too loud."
                    - re.split(r".\s", my_string) - returns: ['', 'lov', 'th', 'musi', 'o', 'Mr.Go', 'However', 'th', 'soun', 'wa', 'to', 'loud.']
                    - re.split(r"\.\s", my_string) - returns: ['I love the music of Mr.Go', 'However, the sound was too loud.']
            5. |: OR Operator
                - my_string = "Elephants are the world's largest land animal! I would love to see an elephant one day"
                - re.findall(r"Elephant|elephant", my_string) - returns: ['Elephant', 'elephant']
            6. []: set of characters representing the OR Operator.
                Example 1 - my_string = "Yesterday I spent my afternoon with my friends: MaryJohn2 Clary3"
                - re.findall(r"[a-zA-Z]+\d", my_string) - returns: ['MaryJohn2', 'Clary3']
                Example 2 - my_string = "My&name&is#John Smith. I%live$in#London."
                - re.sub(r"[#$%&]", " ", my_string) - returns: 'My name is John Smith. I live in London.'
                
                Note 1: within brackets, the characters to be found should not be separated, as in [#$%&].
                    - Whitespaces or other separators would be interpreted as characters to be found.
                Note 2: [a-z] represents all word characters from 'a' to 'z', lowercase.
                        - [A-Z] represents all word characters from 'A' to 'Z', uppercase.
                        - Since lower and uppercase are different, we must declare [a-zA-Z] or [A-Za-z] to capture all word characters.
                        - [0-9] represents all digits from 0 to 9.
                        - Something like [a-zA-Z0-9] or [a-z0-9A-Z] will search all word characters and all numbers.
            
            7. [^ ]: OR operator combined to ^ transforms the expression to negative.
                - my_links = "Bad website: www.99.com. Favorite site: www.hola.com"
                - re.findall(r"www[^0-9]+com", my_links) - returns: ['www.hola.com']

        Examples of regex:

        1. You want to find names of files that appear at the start of the string; 
            - always start with a sequence of 2 or 3 upper or lowercase vowels (a e i o u); 
            - and always finish with the txt ending.
                - Write a regex that matches the pattern of the text file names, e.g. aemyfile.txt.
                # . = match any character
                regex = r"^[aeiouAEIOU]{2,3}.+txt"

        2. When a user signs up on the company website, they must provide a valid email address.
            - The company puts some rules in place to verify that the given email address is valid:
            - The first part can contain: Upper A-Z or lowercase letters a-z; 
            - Numbers; Characters: !, #, %, &, *, $, . Must have @. Domain: Can contain any word characters;

        # regex greedy and non-greedy search
        self.help_text_4 = """
        There are two types of matching methods: greedy and non-greedy (also called lazy) operators. 

        Greedy operators
        - The standard quantifiers are greedy by default, meaning that they will attempt to match as many characters as possible.
            - Standard quantifiers: * , + , ? , {num, num}
            - Example: re.match(r"\d+", "12345bcada") - returns: <_sre.SRE_Match object; span=(0, 5), match='12345'>
            - We can explain this in the following way: our quantifier will start by matching the first digit found, '1'. 
            - Because it is greedy, it will keep going to find 'more' digits and stop only when no other digit can be matched, returning '12345'.
        - If the greedy quantifier has matched so many characters that can not match the rest of pattern, it will backtrack, giving up characters matched earlier one at a time and try again. 
        - Backtracking is like driving a car without a map. If you drive through a path and hit a dead end street, you need to backtrack along your road to an earlier point to take another street. 
            - Example: re.match(r".*hello", "xhelloxxxxxx") - returns: <_sre.SRE_Match object; span=(0, 6), match='xhello'>
            - We use the greedy quantifier .* to find anything, zero or more times, followed by the letters "h" "e" "l" "l" "o". 
            - We can see here that it returns the pattern 'xhello'. 
            - So our greedy quantifier will start by matching as much as possible, the entire string. 
            - Then, it tries to match the h, but there are no characters left. So it backtracks, giving up one matched character. 
            - Trying again, it still doesn't match the h, so it backtracks one more step repeatedly until it finally matches the h in the regex, and the rest of the characters.

        Non-greedy (lazy) operators
        - Because they have lazy behavior, non-greedy quantifiers will attempt to match as few characters as needed, returning the shortest match. 
        - To obtain non-greedy quantifiers, we can append a question mark at the end of the greedy quantifiers to convert them into lazy. 
            - Example: re.match(r"\d+?", "12345bcada") - returns: <_sre.SRE_Match object; span=(0, 1), match='1'>
            - Now, our non-greedy quantifier will return the pattern '1'. 
            - In this case, our quantifier will start by matching the first digit found, '1'. 
            - Because it is non-greedy, it will stop there, as we stated that we want 'one or more', and 1 is as few as needed.
        - Non-greedy quantifiers also backtrack. 
        - In this case, if they have matched so few characters that the rest of the pattern cannot match, they backtrack, expand the matched character one at a time, and try again. 
        - In the example above: this time we use the lazy quantifier .*?. Interestingly, we obtain the same match 'xhello'. 
        - But, how this match was obtained is different from the first time: the lazy quantifier first matches as little as possible, nothing, leaving the entire string unmatched. 
        - Then it tries to match the 'h', but it doesn't work. 
        - So, it backtracks, matching one more character, the 'x'. Then, it tries again, this time matching the 'h', and afterwards, the rest of the regex.

        - Even though greedy quantifiers lead to longer matches, they are sometimes the best option. 
        - Because lazy quantifiers match as few as possible, they return a shorter match than we expected.
            - Example: if you want to extract a word starting with 'a' and ending with 'e' in the string 'I like apple pie', you may think that applying the greedy regex r"a.+e" will return 'apple'. 
            - However, your match will be 'apple pie'. A way to overcome this is to make it lazy by using '?'' which will return 'apple'.
        - On the other hand, using greedy quantifiers always leads to longer matches that sometimes are not desired. 
            - Making quantifiers lazy by adding '?' to match a shorter pattern is a very important consideration to keep in mind when handling data for text mining.

        Examples of regex:

        1. You want to extract the number contained in the sentence 'I was born on April 24th'. 
            - A lazy quantifier will make the regex return 2 and 4, because they will match as few characters as needed. 
            - However, a greedy quantifier will return the entire 24 due to its need to match as much as possible.

            1.1. Use a lazy quantifier to match all numbers that appear in the variable sentiment_analysis:
            numbers_found_lazy = re.findall(r"[0-9]+?", sentiment_analysis)
            - Output: ['5', '3', '6', '1', '2']
            
            1.2. Now, use a greedy quantifier to match all numbers that appear in the variable sentiment_analysis.
            numbers_found_greedy = re.findall(r"[0-9]+", sentiment_analysis)
            - Output: ['536', '12']

        2.1. Use a greedy quantifier to match text that appears within parentheses in the variable sentiment_analysis.
            
            sentences_found_greedy = re.findall(r"\(.+\)", sentiment_analysis)
            - Output: ["(They were so cute) a few yrs ago. PC crashed, and now I forget the name of the site ('I'm crying)"]

        2.2. Now, use a lazy quantifier to match text that appears within parentheses in the variable sentiment_analysis.

            sentences_found_lazy = re.findall(r"\(.+?\)", sentiment_analysis)
            - Output: ["(They were so cute)", "('I'm crying)"]

        # regex grouping and capturing
        self.help_text_5 = """
        Capturing groups in regular expressions
        - Let's say that we have the following text:
            
            text = "Clary has 2 friends who she spends a lot time with. Susan has 3 brothers while John has 4 sisters."
            
        - We want to extract information about a person, how many and which type of relationships they have. 
        - So, we want to extract Clary 2 friends, Susan 3 brothers and John 4 sisters.
        - If we do: re.findall(r'[A-Za-z]+\s\w+\s\d+\s\w+', text), the output will be: ['Clary has 2 friends', 'Susan has 3 brothers', 'John has 4 sisters']
            - The output is quite close, but we do not want the word 'has'.

        - We start simple, by trying to extract only the names. We can place parentheses to group those characters, capture them, and retrieve only that group:
            - re.findall(r'([A-Za-z]+)\s\w+\s\d+\s\w+', text) - returns: ['Clary', 'Susan', 'John']
        - Actually, we can place parentheses around the three groups that we want to capture. 
            - re.findall(r'([A-Za-z]+)\s\w+\s(\d+)\s(\w+)', text)
            
            - Each group will receive a number: 
                - The entire expression will always be group 0. 
                - The first group: 1; the second: 2; and the third: 3.
            
            - The result returned is: [('Clary', '2', 'friends'), ('Susan', '3', 'brothers'), ('John', '4', 'sisters')]
                - We got a list of tuples: 
                    - The first element of each tuple is the match captured corresponding to group 1. 
                    - The second, to group 2. The last, to group 3.
            
            - We can use capturing groups to match a specific subpattern in a pattern. 
            - We can use this information for retrieving the groups by numbers; or to organize data.
                - Example: pets = re.findall(r'([A-Za-z]+)\s\w+\s(\d+)\s(\w+)', "Clary has 2 dogs but John has 3 cats")
                            pets[0][0] == 'Clary'
                            - In the code, we placed the parentheses to capture the name of the owner, the number and which type of pets each one has. 
                            - We can access the information retrieved by using indexing and slicing as seen in the code. 
        
        - Capturing groups have one important feature. 
            - Remember that quantifiers apply to the character immediately to the left. 
            - So, we can place parentheses to group characters and then apply the quantifier to the entire group. 
            
            Example: re.search(r"(\d[A-Za-z])+", "My user name is 3e4r5fg")
                - returns: <_sre.SRE_Match object; span=(16, 22), match='3e4r5f'>
                - In the code, we have placed parentheses to match the group containing a number and any letter. 
                - We applied the plus quantifier to specify that we want this group repeated once or more times. 
            
        - ATTENTION: It's not the same to capture a repeated group AND to repeat a capturing group. 
            
            my_string = "My lucky numbers are 8755 and 33"
            - re.findall(r"(\d)+", my_string) - returns: ['5', '3']
            - re.findall(r"(\d+)", my_string) - returns: ['8755', '33']
            
            - In the first code, we use findall to match a capturing group containing one number. 
                - We want this capturing group to be repeated once or more times. 
                - We get 5 and 3 as an output, because these numbers are repeated consecutively once or more times. 
            - In the second code, we specify that we should capture a group containing one or more repetitions of a number. 

        - Placing a subpattern inside parenthesis will capture that content and stores it temporarily in memory. This can be later reused.

        Examples of regex:

        1. You want to extract the first part of the email. E.g. if you have the email marysmith90@gmail.com, you are only interested in marysmith90.
        - You need to match the entire expression. So you make sure to extract only names present in emails. Also, you are only interested in names containing upper (e.g. A,B, Z) or lowercase letters (e.g. a, d, z) and numbers.
        - regex to match the email capturing only the name part. The name part appears before the @.
            - regex_email = r"([a-z0-9A-Z]+)@\S+"

        2. Text follows a pattern: "Here you have your boarding pass LA4214 AER-CDB 06NOV."
        - You need to extract the information about the flight: 
            - The two letters indicate the airline (e.g LA); the 4 numbers are the flight number (e.g. 4214);
            - The three letters correspond to the departure (e.g AER); the destination (CDB); the date (06NOV) of the flight.
            - All letters are always uppercase.

        - Regular expression to match and capture all the flight information required.
        - Find all the matches corresponding to each piece of information about the flight. Assign it to flight_matches.
        - Complete the format method with the elements contained in flight_matches: 
            - In the first line print the airline and the flight number. 
            - In the second line, the departure and destination. In the third line, the date.

        # Import re
        import re

        # Write regex to capture information of the flight
        regex = r"([A-Z]{2})(\d{4})\s([A-Z]{3})-([A-Z]{3})\s(\d{2}[A-Z]{3})"

        # Find all matches of the flight information
        flight_matches = re.findall(regex, flight)
            
        #Print the matches
        print("Airline: {} Flight number: {}".format(flight_matches[0][0], flight_matches[0][1]))
        print("Departure: {} Destination: {}".format(flight_matches[0][2], flight_matches[0][3]))
        print("Date: {}".format(flight_matches[0][4]))

            - findall() returns a list of tuples. 
            - The nth element of each tuple is the element corresponding to group n. 
            - This provides us with an easy way to access and organize our data.

        # regex alternating and non-capturing groups
        self.help_text_6 = """
        Alternating and non-capturing groups

        - Vertical bar or pipe operator
            - Suppose we have the following string, and we want to find all matches for pet names. 
            - We can use the pipe operator to specify that we want to match cat or dog or bird:
                - my_string = "I want to have a pet. But I don't know if I want a cat, a dog or a bird."
                - re.findall(r"cat|dog|bird", my_string) - returns: ['cat', 'dog', 'bird']
            
            - Now, we changed the string a little bit, and once more we want to find all the pet names, but only those that come after a number and a whitespace. 
            - So, if we specify this again with the pipe operator, we get the wrong output: 
                - my_string = "I want to have a pet. But I don't know if I want 2 cats, 1 dog or a bird."
                - re.findall(r"\d+\scat|dog|bird", my_string) - returns: ['2 cat', 'dog', 'bird']
            
            - That is because the pipe operator works by comparing everything that is to its left (digit whitespace cat) with everything to the right, dog.
            - In order to solve this, we can use alternation. 
                - In simpler terms, we can use parentheses again to group the optional characters:
                
                - my_string = "I want to have a pet. But I don't know if I want 2 cats, 1 dog or a bird."
                - re.findall(r"\d+\s(cat|dog|bird)", my_string) - returns: ['cat', 'dog']
                
                In the code, now the parentheses are added to group cat or dog or bird.
            
            - In the previous example, we may also want to match the number. 
            - In that case, we need to place parentheses to capture the digit group:
            
                - my_string = "I want to have a pet. But I don't know if I want 2 cats, 1 dog or a bird."
                - re.findall(r"(\d)+\s(cat|dog|bird)", my_string) - returns: [('2', 'cat'), ('1', 'dog')]
            
                - In the code, we now use two pair of parentheses and we use findall in the string, so we get a list with two tuples.
            
        - Non-capturing groups
            - Sometimes, we need to group characters using parentheses, but we are not going to reference back to this group. 
            - For these cases, there are a special type of groups called non-capturing groups. 
            - For using them, we just need to add question mark colon inside the parenthesis but before the regex.
            
            regex = r"(?:regex)"
            
            - Example: we have the following string, and we want to find all matches of numbers. 
            
                my_string = "John Smith: 34-34-34-042-980, Rebeca Smith: 10-10-10-434-425"
            
            - We see that the pattern consists of two numbers and dash repeated three times. After that, three numbers, dash, four numbers. 
            - We want to extract only the last part, without the first repeated elements. 
            - We need to group the first two elements to indicate repetitions, but we do not want to capture them. 
            - So, we use non-capturing groups to group \d repeated two times and dash. Then we indicate this group should be repeated three times. Then, we group \d repeated three times, dash, \d repeated three times:
            
                re.findall(r"(?:\d{2}-){3}(\d{3}-\d{3})", my_string) - returns: ['042-980', '434-425']
            
        - Alternation
            - We can combine non-capturing groups and alternation together. 
            - Remember that alternation implies using parentheses and the pipe operand to group optional characters. 
            - Let's suppose that we have the following string. We want to match all the numbers of the day. 
            
                my_date = "Today is 23rd May 2019. Tomorrow is 24th May 19."
            
            - We know that they are followed by 'th' or 'rd', but we only want to capture the number, and not the letters that follow it. 
            - We write our regex to capture inside parentheses \d repeated once or more times. Then, we can use a non-capturing group. 
            - Inside, we use the pipe operator to choose between 'th' or 'rd':
            
                re.findall(r"(\d+)(?:th|rd)", my_date) - returns: ['23', '24']

        - Non-capturing groups are very often used together with alternation. 
        - Sometimes, you have optional patterns and you need to group them. 
        - However, you are not interested in keeping them. It's a nice feature of regex.

        Examples of regex:

        1. Sentiment analysis project: firstly, you want to identify positive tweets about movies and concerts.
        - You plan to find all the sentences that contain the words 'love', 'like', or 'enjoy', and capture that word. 
        - You will limit the tweets by focusing on those that contain the words 'movie' or 'concert' by keeping the word in another group. 
        - You will also save the movie or concert name.
            - For example, if you have the sentence: 'I love the movie Avengers', you match and capture 'love'. 
            - You need to match and capture 'movie'. Afterwards, you match and capture anything until the dot.
            - The list sentiment_analysis contains the text of tweets.
        - Regular expression to capture the words 'love', 'like', or 'enjoy'; 
            - match and capture the words 'movie' or 'concert'; 
            - match and capture anything appearing until the '.'.

            regex_positive = r"(love|like|enjoy).+?(movie|concert)\s(.+?)\."

            - The pipe operator works by comparing everything that is to its left with everything to the right. 
            - Grouping optional patterns is the way to get the correct result.

        2. After finding positive tweets, you want to do it for negative tweets. 
        - Your plan now is to find sentences that contain the words 'hate', 'dislike' or 'disapprove'. 
        - You will again save the movie or concert name. 
        - You will get the tweet containing the words 'movie' or 'concert', but this time, you do not plan to save the word.
            - For example, if you have the sentence: 'I dislike the movie Avengers a lot.', you match and capture 'dislike'. 
            - You will match, but not capture, the word 'movie'. Afterwards, you match and capture anything until the dot.
        - Regular expression to capture the words 'hate', 'dislike' or 'disapprove'; 
            - Match, but do not capture, the words 'movie' or 'concert';

        # regex backreferences
        self.help_text_7 = """
        Backreferences
        - How we can backreference capturing groups.

        Numbered groups
        - Imagine we come across this text, and we want to extract the date: 
            
            text = "Python 3.0 was released on 12-03-2008. It was a major revision of the language. Many of its major features were backported to Python 2.6.x and 2.7.x version series."
            
        - We want to extract only the numbers. So, we can place parentheses in a regex to capture these groups:
            
            regex = r"(\d{1,2})-(\d{1,2})-(\d{4})"

        - We have also seen that each of these groups receive a number. 
        - The whole expression is group 0; the first group, 1; and so on.

        - Let's use .search to match the pattern to the text. 
        - To retrieve the groups captured, we can use the method .group specifying the number of a group we want. 

        Again: .group method retrieves the groups captured.
            - Syntax: searched_string = re.search(r"regex", string)
            re.group(N) - returns N-th group captured (group 0 is the regex itself).

        Example: text = "Python 3.0 was released on 12-03-2008."

            information = re.search('(\d{1,2})-(\d{2})-(\d{4})', text)
            information.group(3) - returns: '2008'
            information.group(0) - returns: '12-03-2008' (regex itself, the entire expression).

        - .group can only be used with .search and .match methods.

        Named groups
        - We can also give names to our capturing groups. 
        - Inside the parentheses, we write '?P', and the name inside angle brackets:

            regex = r"(?P<name>regex)"

        - Let's say we have the following string, and we want to match the name of the city and zipcode in different groups. 
        - We can use capturing groups and assign them the name 'city' and 'zipcode'. 
        - We retrieve the information by using .group, and we indicate the name of the group. 
            
            text = "Austin, 78701"
            cities = re.search(r"(?P<city>[A-Za-z]+).*?(?P<zipcode>\d{5})", text)
            cities.group("city") - returns: 'Austin'
            cities.group("zipcode") - returns: '78701'

        Backreferences
        - There is another way to backreference groups. 
        - In fact, the matched group can be reused inside the same regex or outside for substitution. 
        - We can do this using backslash and the number of the group:

            regex = r'(\d{1,2})-(\d{2})-(\d{4})'
            
            - we can backreference the groups as:
                (\d{1,2}): (\1);
                (\d{2}): (\2)
                (\d{4}): (\3)

        - Example: we have the following string, and we want to find all matches of repeated words. 
        - In the code, we specify that we want to capture a sequence of word characters, then a whitespace.
        - Finally, we write \1. This will indicate that we want to match the first group captured again. 
        - In other words, it says: 'match that sequence of characters that was previously captured once more.' 
            
            sentence = "I wish you a happy happy birthday!"
            re.findall(r"(\w+)\s\1", sentence) - returns: ['happy'] 

        - We get the word 'happy' as an output: this was the repeated word in our string.

        - Now, we want to replace the repeated word with one occurrence of the same word. 
        - In the code, we use the same regex as before, but this time, we use the .sub method. 
        - In the replacement part, we can also reference back to the captured group: 
            - We write r"\1" to say: 'replace the entire expression match with the first captured group.' 
            
            re.sub(r"(\w+)\s\1", r"\1", sentence) - returns: 'I wish you a happy birthday!'
            - In the output string, we have only one occurrence of the word 'happy'.
            
        - We can also use named groups for backreferencing. 
        - To do this, we use ?P= the group name. 

            regex = r"(?P=name)"

        Example:
            sentence = "Your new code number is 23434. Please, enter 23434 to open the door."
            re.findall(r"(?P<code>\d{5}).*?(?P=code)", sentence) - returns: ['23434']

        - In the code, we want to find all matches of the same number. 
        - We use a capturing group and name it 'code'. 
        - Later, we reference back to this group, and we obtain the number as an output.

        - To reference the group back for replacement, we need to use \g and the group name inside angle brackets. 

            regex = r"(\g<name>)"

        Example:
            sentence = "This app is not working! It's repeating the last word word."
            re.sub(r"(?P<word>\w+)\s(?P=word)", r"\g<word>", sentence) - returns: 'This app is not working! It's repeating the last word.'
            
        - In the code, we want to replace repeated words by one occurrence of the same word. 
        - Inside the regex, we use the previous syntax. 
        - In the replacement field, we need to use this new syntax as seen in the code.
        - Backreferences are very helpful when you need to reuse part of the regex match inside the regex.
        - You should remember that the group zero stands for the entire expression matched. 
            - It is always helpful to keep that in mind. Sometimes you will need to use it.

        Examples of regex:

        1. Parsing PDF files: your company gave you some PDF files of signed contracts. The goal of the project is to create a database with the information you parse from them. 
        - Three of these columns should correspond to the day, month, and year when the contract was signed.
        - The dates appear as 'Signed on 05/24/2016' ('05' indicating the month, '24' the day). 
        - You decide to use capturing groups to extract this information. Also, you would like to retrieve that information so you can store it separately in different variables.
        - The variable contract contains the text of one contract.

        - Write a regex that captures the month, day, and year in which the contract was signed. 
        - Scan contract for matches.
        - Assign each captured group to the corresponding keys in the dictionary.
        - Complete the positional method to print out the captured groups. 
        - Use the values corresponding to each key in the dictionary.

            # Write regex and scan contract to capture the dates described
            regex_dates = r"Signed\son\s(\d{2})/(\d{2})/(\d{4})"
            dates = re.search(regex_dates, contract)

            # Assign to each key the corresponding match
            signature = {
                "day": dates.group(2),
                "month": dates.group(1),
                "year": dates.group(3)
            }
            # Complete the format method to print-out
            print("Our first contract is dated back to {data[year]}. Particularly, the day {data[day]} of the month {data[month]}.".format(data=signature))

        - Remember that each capturing group is assigned a number according to its position in the regex. 
        - Only if you use .search() and .match(), you can use .group() to retrieve the groups.

        2. The company is going to develop a new product which will help developers automatically check the code they are writing. 
        - You need to write a short script for checking that every HTML tag that is open has its proper closure.
        - You have an example of a string containing HTML tags: "<title>The Data Science Company</title>"
        - You learn that an opening HTML tag is always at the beginning of the string, and appears inside "<>". 
        - A closing tag also appears inside "<>", but it is preceded by "/".
        - The list html_tags, contains strings with HTML tags.

        - Regex to match closed HTML tags: find if there is a match in each string of the list html_tags. Assign the result to match_tag;
            - If a match is found, print the first group captured and saved in match_tag;
        - If no match is found, regex to match only the text inside the HTML tag. Assign it to notmatch_tag.
            - Print the first group captured by the regex and save it in notmatch_tag.
            - To capture the text inside <>, place parenthesis around the expression: r"<(text)>. To confirm that the same text appears in the closing tag, reference back to the m group captured by using '\m'.
            - To print the 'm' group captured, use .group(m).

            for string in html_tags:
                # Complete the regex and find if it matches a closed HTML tags
                match_tag =  re.match(r"<(\w+)>.*?</\1>", string)

                if match_tag:
                    # If it matches print the first group capture
                    print("Your tag {} is closed".format(match_tag.group(1))) 
                else:
                    # If it doesn't match capture only the tag 
                    notmatch_tag = re.match(r"<(\w+)>",string)
                    # Print the first group capture
                    print("Close your {} tag!".format(notmatch_tag.group(1)))

        3. Your task is to replace elongated words that appear in the tweets. 
        - We define an elongated word as a word that contains a repeating character twice or more times. 
            - e.g. "Awesoooome".
        - Replacing those words is very important since a classifier will treat them as a different term from the source words, lowering their frequency.
        - To find them, you will use capturing groups and reference them back using numbers. E.g \4.
        - If you want to find a match for 'Awesoooome', you firstly need to capture 'Awes'. 
            - Then, match 'o' and reference the same character back, and then, 'me'.
        - The list sentiment_analysis contains the text tweets.
        - Regular expression to match an elongated word as described.
        - Search the elements in sentiment_analysis list to find out if they contain elongated words. Assign the result to match_elongated.
        - Assign the captured group number zero to the variable elongated_word.
            - Print the result contained in the variable elongated_word.

            # Complete the regex to match an elongated word
            regex_elongated = r"\w*(\w)\1*me\w*"

            for tweet in sentiment_analysis:
                # Find if there is a match in each tweet 
                match_elongated = re.search(regex_elongated, tweet)

                if match_elongated:
                    # Assign the captured group zero 
                    elongated_word = match_elongated.group(0)

                    # Complete the format method to print the word
                    print("Elongated word found: {word}".format(word=elongated_word))
                else:
                    print("No elongated word found") 

                """
        
        # regex lookaround
        self.help_text_8 = """
        Lookaround
        - There are specific types of non-capturing groups that help us look around an expression.
        - Look-around will look for what is behind or ahead of a pattern. 
        - Imagine that we have the following string:
            
            text = "the white cat sat on the chair"

        - We want to see what is surrounding a specific word. 
        - For example, we position ourselves in the word 'cat'. 
        - So look-around will let us answer the following problem: 
            - At my current position, look ahead and search if 'sat' is there. 
            - Or, look behind and search if 'white' is there.
            
        - In other words, looking around allows us to confirm that a sub-pattern is ahead or behind the main pattern.
        - "At my current position in the matching process, look ahead or behind and examine whether some pattern matches or not match before continuing."
        - In the previous example, we are looking for the word 'cat'. 
        - The look ahead expression can be either positive or negative. For positive we use ?=. For negative, ?!.
            - positive: (?=sat)
            - negative: (?!run)

        - Look-ahead
        - This non-capturing group checks whether the first part of the expression is followed or not by the lookahead expression. 
        - As a consequence, it will return the first part of the expression. 
            - Let's imagine that we have a string containing file names and the status of that file. 
            - We want to extract only those files that are followed by the word 'transferred'. 
            - So we start building the regex by indicating any word character followed by .txt.
            - We now indicate we want the first part to be followed by the word transferred. 
            - We do so by writing ?= and then whitespace transferred all inside the parenthesis:
            
            my_text ="tweets.txt transferred, mypass.txt transferred, keywords.txt error"
            re.findall(r"\w+\.txt(?=\stransferred)", my_text) - returns: ['tweets.txt', 'mypass.txt']

        - Negative look-ahead
            - Now, let's use negative lookahead in the same example.
            - In this case, we will say that we want those matches that are NOT followed by the expression 'transferred'. 
            - We use, instead, ?! inside parenthesis:

            my_text = "tweets.txt transferred, mypass.txt transferred, keywords.txt error"
            re.findall(r"\w+\.txt(?!\stransferred)", my_text) - returns: ['keywords.txt']

        - Look-behind
        - The non-capturing group look-behind gets all matches that are preceded or not by a specific pattern.
        - As a consequence, it will return the matches after the look expression.
        - Look behind expression can also be either positive or negative. 
            - For positive, we use ?<=. For negative, ?<!.
            - So, we add an intermediate '<' (angle bracket) sign. In the previous example, we can look before the word 'cat': 
                - positive: (?<=white)
                - negative: (?<!brown)
            
        - Positive look-behind
            - Let's look at the following string, in which we want to find all matches of the names that are preceded by the word 'member'. 
            - We construct our regex with positive look-behind. 
            - At the end of the regex, we indicate that we want a sequence of word characters whitespace another sequence of word characters:
            
            my_text = "Member: Angus Young, Member: Chris Slade, Past: Malcolm Young, Past: Cliff Williams."
            re.findall(r"(?<=Member:\s)\w+\s\w+", my_text) - returns: ['Angus Young', 'Chris Slade']
            
            - Pay attention to the code: the look-behind expression goes before that expression. 
            - We indicate ?<= followed by member, colon, and whitespace. All inside parentheses. 
            - In that way we get the two names that were preceded by the word member, as shown in the output.

        - Negative look-behind
        - Now, we have other string, in which will use negative look-behind. 
        - We will find all matches of the word 'cat' or 'dog' that are not preceded by the word 'brown'. 
        - In this example, we use ?<!, followed by brown, whitespace. All inside the parenthesis. 
        - Then, we indicate our alternation group: 'cat' or 'dog'. 

            my_text = "My white cat sat at the table. However, my brown dog was lying on the couch."
            re.findall(r"(?<!brown\s)(cat|dog)", my_text) - returns: ['cat']

            - Consequently, we get 'cat' as an output, the 'cat' or 'dog' word that is not after the word 'brown'.

        In summary:
        - Positive lookahead (?=) makes sure that first part of the expression is followed by the lookahead expression. 
        - Positive lookbehind (?<=) returns all matches that are preceded by the specified pattern.
        - It is important to know that positive lookahead will return the text matched by the first part of the expression after asserting that it is followed by the lookahead expression,
            - while positive lookbehind will return all matches that follow a specific pattern.
        - Negative lookarounds work in a similar way to positive lookarounds. 
            - They are very helpful when we are looking to exclude certain patterns from our analysis.

        Examples of regex:

        1. You are interested in the words surrounding 'python'. You want to count how many times a specific words appears right before and after it.
        - The variable sentiment_analysis contains the text of one tweet.
        - Get all the words that are followed by the word 'python' in sentiment_analysis. 
        - Print out the word found.
            - In re.findall(). Use \w+ to match the words followed by the word 'python';
            - In re.findall() first argument, include \spython within parentheses to indicate that everything after the word 'python' should be matched.

            # Positive lookahead
            look_ahead = re.findall(r"\w+(?=\spython)", sentiment_analysis)

            # Print out
            print(look_ahead)
        
        1.2. Get all the words that are preceded by the word 'python' or 'Python' in sentiment_analysis. Print out the words found.
        - In re.findall() first argument, include [Pp]ython\s within parentheses to indicate that everything before the word 'python' (or 'Python') should be matched.

            # Positive lookbehind
            look_behind = re.findall(r"(?<=[pP]ython\s)\w+", sentiment_analysis)

            # Print out
            print(look_behind)

        2. You need to write a script for a cell-phone searcher. 
        - It should scan a list of phone numbers and return those that meet certain characteristics.
        - The phone numbers in the list have the structure:
            - Optional area code: 3 numbers
            - Prefix: 4 numbers
            - Line number: 6 numbers
            - Optional extension: 2 numbers
            - E.g. 654-8764-439434-01.
        - You decide to use .findall() and the non-capturing group's negative lookahead (?!) and negative lookbehind (?<!).
        - The list cellphones, contains three phone numbers:
            cellphones = ['4564-646464-01', '345-5785-544245', '6476-579052-01']

        - Get all cell phones numbers that are not preceded by the optional area code.
            - In re.findall() first argument, you use a negative lookbehind ?<! within parentheses () indicating the optional area code.

            for phone in cellphones:
                # Get all phone numbers not preceded by area code
                number = re.findall(r"(?<!\d{3}-)\d{4}-\d{6}-\d{2}", phone)
                print(number)
        
        2.1. Get all the cell phones numbers that are not followed by the optional extension.
            - In re.findall() first argument, you use a negative lookahead ?! within parentheses () indicating the optional extension.

            for phone in cellphones:
                # Get all phone numbers not followed by optional extension
                number = re.findall(r"\d{3}-\d{4}-\d{6}(?!-\d{2})", phone)
